Online community-building seems like a dark art. Surely those sites which haved develop thriving communities must employ the dark arts in order to achieve their successs, right?

In any case, I am determined to figure out some mixture of content, newsletters, social interaction, and eye of newt that will result in a thriving community. My hope is that you, majestic reader, will benefit from my foibles.

I'll focus on a community I'm trying to bootstrap, Grateful Place, which can be found at http://gratefulplace.com. I'll write about the decisions I make, the reasons I'm making them, and whether the decisions result in success or failure. 

Good luck to us as we sally forth into that maddening, danger-filled territory of web development: community building!
