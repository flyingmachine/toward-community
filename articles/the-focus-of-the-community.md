Probably the best plcae to start in building a community is figuring
out the focus of the community.

What is the focus of Grateful Place?

"A positive community for sharing gratitude"

The idea behind grateful place is that if you practice gratitude
daily, you will be happier. That's it.

But what's the social component of it? Be a part of a community for
doing the same thing. Find other people who want to make a change. Who
will support you in trying to make a change. Who will support you in
being less cynical.

"A community for supporting the cultivation of gratitude."

So not just sharing what you're grateful. Sharing your journey to
becoming more grateful.

Make it a private community.

You want to support that focus.

You want to support people in achieving that focus.
