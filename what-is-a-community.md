# If You Want to Build a Community, First Define Community

Before embarking on this quest to build an online community, it will
be helpful to actually have a working definition of "community." I'll
explore the definition of a community as a group where you feel
understood and accepted. Then, I'll provide some examples of how the
definition plays out in real life, including in tech communities and
in improv comedy.

## Belonging

As a first step, here's a quote from Peter Block's book Community: The
Structure of Belonging:

> We are in community each time we find a place where we belong.

That definition is intuitively satisfying. If you ask yourself, "Do I
ever simultaneously feel like I'm part of a community and that I don't
belong?" the answer will be no (unless you're in a disagreeable mood
or you're fond of splitting hairs, which is really just being
perpetually disagreeable). 

But this answer is just moving the goal posts because it leaves us
with another question: what causes you to feel like you belong in a
community? I think the answer has two parts:

* You feel understood
* You feel accepted

## Feeling Understood

I think it's human nature to seek the company of others who share your
interests or your circumstances. When you know that someone has gone
through the same or similar experiences, you're confident that they
can understand you. The need to be understood is probably one of our
deepest needs.

For example, I enjoy being part of programmer communities because it's
gratifying to feel understood as a programmer. It's gratifying to
share the unique trials and tribulations of my profession with others
who completely get where I'm coming from. It's nice to share things
that interest me with other people without causing their eyes to glaze
over. Similarly, it's fun to hear about others' experiences.

As a more sober example, years ago I attended a group meeting for
people who were taking care of a chronically ill loved one. As a
caretaker, I felt that people who hadn't been in that situation really
couldn't understand what an intense trial it was, and I felt compelled
to seek the company of others in a similar situation.

Whether it's a deep and abiding interest in typography or grappling
with uncommon circumstances, we all have uncommon facets of ourselves
that we want others to understand.

## Feeling Accepted

Perhaps more important than being understood is being accepted. I'm
sure there are evolutionary / biological reasons for this having to do
with social acceptance leading to the propagation of our species or
whatever. What's important is that this is another fundamental human
need.

We all know what it's like not to feel accepted. When others treat you
as somehow inferior or unworthy, it's painful.
[In fact, social rejection triggers the same areas of your brain that are active when you're experiencing physical pain](http://carterlab.ucdavis.edu/courses/psc261/eisenberger_lieberman_williams_S2003.pdf).

The reason why I separate feeling understood and feeling accepted is
that it's possible for a group to reject you even if you have similar
interests or experiences. A more benign example of this is a men's or
women's support group. The men in a men's support group might not
harbor any negative feelings towards women; they just want a space
where they can talk to a group of other men. Less benign examples
abound: racism, sexism, and homophobia are the most prominent examples
of denigrating social rejection, the kind that undermines the
target's worth as a human being.

So, a community is a group of people who feel understood and accepted
by each other. Put another way: a community is a group of people who
provide understanding and acceptance for each other.

## Improv Comedy Provides the Ingredients for Instant Community

I've been taking improv classes for a good long while now, and I've
found that the fundamental ideas of improv make it incredibly easy to
feel like you're part of the community.

One of the ideas is to support the hell out of your scene partner.
Whatever your scene partner does, you're not going to shoot it down.
If your partner says "Hey Jerry, that's a nice cowboy hat," it would
be bad improv to say, "This isn't a cowboy hat! It's a turban!" or "My
name's not Jerry, it's Moses. And you're dead so why are you talking?"

Even your scene partner does something that makes you cringe or that
you think isn't funny, you're going to support the hell out of him and
let him know that you've got his back. This about as accepting as it
gets.

By making "support" a community value like this, it makes it easier
for performers to loosen up and take risks. Even if they make
mistakes, even if they fail, they know that their teammates aren't
going to judge them. They'll be cheering for them the whole time.

In my own experience, I find myself being more "myself" at improv than
I am most other places. I know I can exhibit all my weirdness fully
and proudly, and it will be accepted. By showing more of myself, I
feel understood as well.

Because of my experiences in improv, I think that one of the keys to
building a strong community is to consciously support the hell out of
each other.

## Understanding and Acceptance in Tech Communities: Sexism

For me, the definition of community as understanding + acceptance
helps to clarify the ongoing discussion about sexism in technology
communities that I continue to read about.

Hostile tech communities might be able to provide understanding for
their female members. My presumption is that female members feel
understood; they can relate to others in the community when it comes
to programming or design or whatever.

But these communities fail in providing full acceptance, in ensuring
that the dignity and worth of female members is recognized and
respected. Here's
[an appalling list](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_incidents)
of sexism incidents that illustrates the kind of denigration I'm
refering to.

## Understanding and Acceptance in Tech Communities: Noobs

One of the regular topics on the boston.rb mailing list is how to be
more inclusive of noobs. Taking the approach of understanding +
acceptance, I think the issue can be addressed in two ways.

First, by building understanding. In the case of boston.rb, they've
started monthly "project nights" which are meant specifically to help
Ruby novices learn the language. By building this understanding,
novices can begin to gain that sense of belonging as they accumulate
experiences (metaprogramming, wowee!) which other community members
share.

Second, by building acceptance. I actually don't know how to do this
effectively. The mailing list is always very polite when answering a
question, no matter how inane. However, I still sometimes see posts
from noobs saying that they feel reluctant to ask their very basic
questions.


## What's Next?

Going forward I'm going to operate on the definition of community as a
place where members provide understanding and acceptance for each
other. I'm also going to assume that one of the keys to building a
good community is to explicitly follow the mantra, "support the hell
out of each other."

What this means for Grateful Place, my nascent community focused on
gratitude, I don't know yet. But it's definitely sparked some ideas. I
look forward to exploring them and sharing them!
